<hr><P class="note" value="2">Introduction
<hr>English is an essential language for communication around the globe. According to the United Nations, there are 67 out of 193 countries and around 1.5 billion people recognising English as their official or co-official language, explicitly revealing the significance of this language in the world. In daily life, aside from the mother tongue language, people nowadays can speak multiple languages at the same time, not only being bilingual but also trilingual as well. This further proves that our languages of communication have been changing a lot. What is more, with the advancement of technology and innovation of digital devices, undoubtedly, the ways of communication have been alternating with the use of technology. Hence, it is very paramount to understand why the changes are taking places and how these are evolving to influence our uses of language.</p>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">The Origin of English 
<hr>First and foremost, languages are progressively growing and expanding for connecting the world, meaning to build relationships with one another out of the borders and boundaries. In the past, the owner of English was British Empire, who started to invade the other countries in the 18th century. The colonisation widely spread, the British taught those colonised countries English and instructed the people to follow their house rules. For instance, Hong Kong, after the First Opium War, was turning into the colony of the Great Britain in 1942 and ceded to her from times to times. It was noteworthy to let the history to tell why English became the common language of the people in different parts of the world, due to the war factor. 
Within the British Empire, the language development was accounted for the migrations due to the open of the Roman Empire and the sea exploration from Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, forming the Old English at the beginning. It consisted of various of cultural groups, geographically distributing and stationing at different regions, such Old English, Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Frisian, North Sea Germanic and Roman. This Old English language was developing through the interactions between them and continued to change when they built their own kingdoms, which were later being attacked by the Vikings and Scandinavians. 
The invasions shaped the development of the Old English by adding their languages, grammars and vocabulary to form the Old Norse as the Middle English. Over the time, more words from France were adopted and the Old English was started to fade down because of the cultural shifts. The modern English or contemporary English began during the emergence of printing press from Renaissance spreading across the Europe. The rise of a group of literate people published tremendous publications such as sonnets, poets, bibles, plays, dramas, causing the change of spellings, vowels, syntaxes, and the uses of languages. In today’s world, the frequent use of social media and the globalisation effect reflect how the English language has been changing and used for communication. It is important to get to know that the edible English is growing by consensus and compromisation.</P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">Technology and English
<hr>To be a competent and an expert writer, a broad range of vocabulary, good memorisation of grammar rules and a taste of expression are critical to generate masterpieces, which are always long-lasting to refresh and delve into its virtues for deep meanings. People nowadays highly rely on the use of artificial intelligence and technology to improve productivity and do things at convenience, while many integrity and plagiarism issues arise, placing at a high concern since human’s manual works are weighed much values than a machine’s. Even though it looks cerebral and smart to make good use of AI, the key is not to overuse and exploit it to the extent that creates the loss of originality, the core of education. When students come to study a degree, no matter it is a Bachelor or a Master of English Language, they are supposed to be trained as language and communication expertise, by having a pair of authentic eyes, hands and ears for reading, writing and listening, with fluent speeches and accurate pronunciations delivering from their mouths.</P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">The Use of Technology and Training
<hr>The use of technology is a double-edge sword, and the awareness of adopting this function has to be or recommended to be practiced together with professionals recognised in the institutions or chartered organisations. When the artificial intelligence is the OpenAI, which can be used by anyone who has the Wi-fi and a laptop, it is of importance to know who use it correctly and who has the malpractice, ruining the integrity in the academia. Therefore, teaching students or training them to take these issues seriously is what the teachers need to be on the stick. These teachers are the one to guide them to use the machine according to the agreed rules of practice. Thus, the use of technology and AI is part of weighing in the marking scheme, meaning that students have to be subjected to the rules of using the AI by the teachers.</P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">English as an Appreciation
<hr>In addition, English, as a form of arts, is for appreciation to a great extent, in which teachers have to let students know why the particular sayings and choice of words are better than the other ways of expressions. At the same time, students are encouraged to discuss in the classes to learn collectively instead of individually, so that they come to grips with the communication skills, such as compromising, negotiating and justifying. For instance, it is far more than appreciation, but to cultivate critical thinking for professional judgement and evaluation. Therefore, when technology only acts as a supportive tool for alternative options, the programme trains students to be analytical and skeptical not to overuse the generative AI.</P> 

<hr><P class="note" value="2">English and Artificial Intelligence Application
<hr>With the mature development of machine learning and neural language programming, there are numerous sounding English correction platforms and apps. The early one is the Grammarly, which labels itself as a free writing assistant, mostly used in the office for fundamental correction of grammar in the official letters and mails. The later development applies not only in writing but also speaking as well, showing the trend of its innovative development. Furthermore, by navigating the Internet, various AI essay tools to help users to adjust their language tones, such as ChatGPT and DEEPSEEK are commonly used and strongly built. Some specific tools shine in the market are tailored for IELTS writings or any other English qualification exams.</P> 
As a result, on one hand, these can be a storytelling part of the English development history. On the other hand, students should understand the theories behind of these tools. For example, how they can work for the corrections and what are the rules and instructions prioritizing to formulate the outputs, are keys to find out. When the students have the basic knowledge of these, it is expected that the teaching in classes is more intellectual and circumspective. In the meantime, students can critically evaluate what are the general mistakes taking places when they write an essay. 
Aside from writing, the AI applications in speaking have an influence too, in which the AI can track whether the sound frequency, speed and tonality are perfectly matched with the natives’ pronunciations and ways of speaking. Although this is a game-liked revolution of English speaking, it is important to know how to use this effectively, and the challenges and differences compared with the vis-à-vis oral teaching. For reading and listening sessions, even though there are not many developments in AI, the possibility and suggestion of innovative applications come on the spotlight. Thus, this should be included in the class discussion.</P> 

<hr><P class="note" value="2">Impact of English in Social Media 
<hr>Different from formal business and academic English, the language use in social media is comparatively colloquial and full of slangs, which are worth to collect for corpus development. Yet, it is more crucial to understand the positive and negative meanings of communication from the psychological perspective, meaning that human should be able to truly understand the literal and figurative meaning of expressions. It can be very apt or novel, be it conventional or unconventional. In fact, there are lots of mixed words invented for fun and jokes, happening in the social medias more often than the educational channels, and its impacts and the consequences should be taken into account and chased back the originality for functional purpose.  Sometimes, these newly-created words are put on the table for discussion and they have to be examined with rules before passing to be part of the vocabulary bank.</P> 

<hr><P class="note" value="2">Areas of English Teachings
<hr>My interest is in English language. I have some experience in teaching Primary English privately, writing a paper about metaphor study and using diversified AI applications in enhancing English. Thus, these experiences can be packaging in five different topics of teaching: History of English, English and Technology Applications, English in Education Settings, English Editing and Reflection, and English and Research. </P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">History of English
<hr>Since my previous working experience includes being a research assistant, I am very capable in summarising the milestones of English language development systematically, including adding the latest trend of AI applications. For instance, the summary is supported by good references of books and hardcore, long time reading. Some latest systematic reviews and videos are found to be shared in classes. My job is helping students to quickly get the right information after filtrations. Elaborations and explanations are possible when students ask questions about the history. Students should be able to comprehend and acquire the historical facts and development trend of English after studying the programme. Moreover, they can have personal research on different periods of English development, including vocabulary examples of changes in class. </P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">English and Technology Application
<hr>These can be a workshop running format, since students should begin with learning the research integrity issues when they write their papers. Paraphrasing and consolidating are necessary when they are academically proven to use AI to know and explore the possible ways of writing. However, they should declare that there is no direct copying of words into their essay writings. Otherwise, penalties like mark deductions are informed in class and apparently stated in the course outline and marking scheme. 
Some generative AI tools can be tested together in order to provide a relaxing but constructive learning mode. Students are expected to analyse by themselves in groups on what kinds of rules are important for building a generative AI to correct “a wrong sentence” and a sample of coding can be given (GitHub). This is an initiative trial class for students who have interests in this area, but they should find their own teachers for further learning. </P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">English in Education Settings
<hr>A framework is on the spot, reflecting that curriculum design is vital to English language teaching and learning. For instance, students in classes are supposed to be English school teachers, trainers, coaches and etc. They can sit together and discuss in group about the English curriculum from kindergarten level to tertiary education level, or even adult education. Students can also list out what are the important  cornerstones that their students have to learn, while they can share some of the problems faced including the special needs cases. 
On top of that, my Master is Education at The University of Hong Kong. It is possible to share the learning theories from the psychological perspectives to examine the English mastery pathways in different school levels. This can be a brand-new angle from students specialising in English to grasp with the knowledge in motivation of learning. </P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">English Editing and Reflection
<hr>Poor or moderate level essays are given to students for editing. They should do these exercises regularly for improving their skills of writing. Good poems and pieces of writings are provided to write reflections in the alternative weeks. </P>

<hr><P class="note" value="2">English and Research 
<hr>My Bachelor degree honorary project is about a type of metaphor understanding, the predicative metaphors classifying into four dimensions based on typicality and aptness. This is a sharing on how to conduct experimental comprehension research while the research materials can be completely different from the types of metaphors used and invented. It is a 30-minute presentation for brainstorming how to understand and comprehend the sentence creation in English.</P>
