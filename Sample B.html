  <h1>Young people today don’t make good use of their time and spend too much time watching TV and playing video games instead of participating in more productive activities. 
  <hr>Do you agree or disagree?</h1>

  <h2><P class="note" value="2">Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant answers from your own knowledge or experience. There is a heated debate on young adolescents putting too much time on TV watching and video game playing, but not spending their precious time on participating rewarding and fulfilling activities, such as volunteering and hobby development. From my point view, it is generally true and apparently valid that teenagers during their immature ages without monitoring and supervision are easy to be addicted to unhealthy leisure activities. Sometimes, in a more seriously way, they can be vulnerable to go astray, elicit misbehaviours and perform poorly. 
  <hr>Nowadays, tremendous cyber activities are on rapid development, attracting a large group gamers and audiences to join the regular and special events, in which most of the participants are youngsters who are keen on playing the e-sports activity. It is a notable worldwide game that emerges in the virtual reality and entertaining world. Even though the e-sports are organised formally and officially with the unwavering support from the business corporations, many potential harms are invisibly existing such as health issues, financial problems and academic concerns for career developments. Hence, there are real considerations on how much time and money these teenagers investing on gaming activities. 
  <hr>On top of that, younger children are prone to watch more televisions without systematic control, when their parents are at work. They are not only too young to have a good sense of self-control, but also are enticed by various shows broadcasting in the commercial TV. As a result, eyesight problems become a big issue for the children, who have to wear glasses at schools. Alternatively, at these prime ages, young people should utilise their spare time on extra-curricular activities and meaningful activities, like volunteering to help those in need. Aside from hobby and interest growing, they are encouraged to join some welfare clubs to lead a personalised game for elderly or poor, or go to the environmental protection organisations to grow trees and conduct rubbish cleaning campaign. These are regarded as the community building services, which are paramount for cultivating the young peoples’ social awareness, commitment and responsibility. 
  <hr>All in all, young adolescents now have many choices in their hands, while time is limited. It is urged that parents should pay attention on their personal development and growth by ushering their children to take part in enriching and knowledgeable activities.</P></h2>
