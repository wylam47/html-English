  <h1>Modern lifestyles are completely different from the way people lived in the past. Some people think the changes have been very positive, while others believe they have been negative. 
    Discuss both these points of view and give your own opinion. </h1>
  <h2><P class="note" value="2">Our livelihoods are rapidly changing as a result of the globalization, international exchange and sustainability development after several humane reforms over the decades, including the improvements in healthcare, education and facilities. For instance, the ways of living today are totally different from the past in terms of its living standards and quality. Based on these transformations, different people, holding diverse standpoints, have both positive and negative views. There are contradictions in between, while people, as a group within urban populations, practically opt for protecting not only their individual interests, but also the collective benefits for the eternal growth in their communities. (← Keep your introduction short and to the point — just 1–2 sentences.) 
    First and foremost, mammoth advantages such as a sanitary environment, efficient and convenient transportation, and various recreational facilities exist nowadays, which are for adaptation and improvement of the city urbanization. In fact, people from the rural areas may benefit from these developments through their local governments and organizations as they can access the free facilities and services provided, enjoy easy commuting with fast-paced transportations, and live in the hygienic and healthy cities. (<- Add another sentence to extend the body paragraph and provide more detail. Use specific, topic-related words to explain what you mean by “convenient transportation,” such as tunnels, bridges, highways, subway stations, or bus lanes.
    However, the growth of cities is costly and comes with a price. People in the communities have to discuss with their local governments, which are responsible for overseeing the urban planning and development. Some old buildings may require to be demolished, causing the removals of the indigenous people and affecting their original lifestyles. In addition, small shops and stores are often needed to be replaced by large branches and chains during the new town development. All these require substantial measurements and negotiations within the communities. Thus, it is not only time-consuming, but also demands tremendous effort. (← Make sure the supporting sentences clearly relate to the topic sentence. For instance, if you mention the cost of living, follow up by explaining what it covers—such as rent, groceries, and other daily expenses—and how these costs have become unaffordable compared to the average monthly income.
    In conclusion, although there are pros and cons in the development process of the modern lifestyles, it is necessary to forgo some past ways of living to adapt the new changes for better livelihoods. (← Clearly state your opinion. For example, say whether you believe modern lifestyles are mostly beneficial, mostly detrimental, or a mix of both. Then briefly summarize your key points—such as convenience versus the rising cost of living—to support your view.)
